This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin version incompatibility. The error message is often vague and doesn't directly point to the solution.  The project might have conflicting dependencies or incorrect configurations in the `android/build.gradle` or `android/app/build.gradle` files.  Specifically, issues arise when different parts of the project require different versions of the Android Gradle Plugin, resulting in a build failure.
