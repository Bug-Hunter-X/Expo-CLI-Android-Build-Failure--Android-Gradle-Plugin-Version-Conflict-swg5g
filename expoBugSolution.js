The solution involves carefully checking and updating the `build.gradle` files in the `android` directory. First, ensure that the versions specified in `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` are compatible and consistent.  It's often recommended to use the latest stable version of the Android Gradle Plugin.  If using different versions of Expo packages, be sure that they are compatible.  If necessary, you may also need to resolve dependency conflicts using techniques such as dependency resolution strategies within the Gradle files.  

For example, you might need to specify the exact versions of dependencies in `android/app/build.gradle` to avoid conflicts:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1")
    // ... other dependencies with specific versions
}
```

After making changes to the Gradle files, clean and rebuild the project using the Expo CLI.  This may require running commands like `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android`.  If problems persist, carefully compare the versions specified with the official Expo documentation for the specific versions of Expo libraries being used.
